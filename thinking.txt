Okay so constructed message, able to connect to the node and preform the handshake


next is to be able to read the messages from the buffer continuously,

So read some bytes, check to see if it starts with the magic number
    - if it does then get the full message and read it
    - if it isn't then




FOR THE BLOCKS
1. Get the block hashes as they're coming is
2. When a user wants more information, would use getdata command with the block hash - here get the info needed
3. Could get all the previous block






Should add an error message when connecting
- Check your DNS settings
